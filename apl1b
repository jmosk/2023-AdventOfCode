     digits←'one' 'two' 'three' 'four' 'five' 'six' 'seven' 'eight' 'nine'∘.⍷d  ⍝ 9 rows with 1 where each digit exists
     ⍝ Multiple each row by digit number, then sum by columns and you get where digits start
     numLoc←⊃+⌿(⍳9)×{digits[⍵;]}¨⍳9     ⍝ Where words start two1nine = 2 0 0 0 9 0 0 0

⍝   Old version below went here. Now replaced with "selectve replacement"

     mask←numLoc>0                 ⍝ Where the digits are to be placed
     fillData←(mask/¨numLoc)       ⍝ Get the replacement digis alone
        ⍝ Can also be done by {⍵~0} ¨numLoc as '~' is 'without' & removes info
     fillData←{(1↓⎕D)[⍵]}¨fillData ⍝ Convert the digits to characters
     (mask/¨word2Num)←fillData     ⍝ Put the chars into the data vector in the right place


⍝   This was the initial way to merge the digits into the data. It is very
⍝   involved in creating a matrix of <data,111...,222..., ... 999...>
⍝   then putting the original data in place of the string of digits
⍝   where the original data remains. Then we rotate each row by 1 and use
⍝   the first character of each row which has the correct letter in its
⍝   position. A convoluted way of doing this until I learn of
⍝   "selective replacement" through a stackoverflow post.

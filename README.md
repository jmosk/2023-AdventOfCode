The purpose of these solutions is NOT to create the most efficient and complex one-line
solutions to each puzzle but to provide a detailed solution along with an explanation of each
of the steps taken to get the correct answer. 

This set of solutions might be of interest to new APL users. First, the general way of
approaching the solution is discussed. Then there is a step-by-step breakdown of how
the solution is implemented. The apl##_trace version displays the output from each
function performed along the way to the solution so the reader can follow along
and understand what each step is doing and how the primitives are deriving the data
shown.

This is a slow work in progress as I have time to work on the 2023 puzzles. But I thought
it could be of interest to have fully documented solutions to the puzzles. 

Code to solve AoC puzzles are of the form:<br>
<li> apl#a - for part 1
<li>  apl#b - for part 2 - But part 2 is sometimes in the same file as part 1<br>
<br>Verification of sample data is:
<li>  apl#a_trace - with results of each step displayed
<li>  apl#b_trace
<br><br>Data is:
<li>  test#a.txt - sample data
<li>test#b.txt
<li> data#a.txt - AoC data to process
<li>data#b.txt - oftentimes data#a.txt is used for both parts
</li>
